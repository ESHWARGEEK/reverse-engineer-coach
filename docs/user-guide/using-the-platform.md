## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Project Creation Issues

**Problem**: "No repositories found for concept"
- **Solution**: Try more specific or alternative terms
- **Example**: Instead of "web development", try "React component patterns"

**Problem**: Repository analysis fails
- **Solution**: Check if repository is public and accessible
- **Alternative**: Try a different repository or check your GitHub token

### Workspace Issues

**Problem**: Code files won't load
- **Solution**: Verify your GitHub token has proper permissions
- **Check**: Ensure repository is still available and public

**Problem**: AI coach not responding
- **Solution**: Check your AI API key status and quota
- **Verify**: Test API credentials in profile settings

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow repository discovery
- **Solution**: Try more specific search terms to reduce search scope
- **Alternative**: Use manual repository URL entry for known repositories

**Problem**: Workspace loading slowly
